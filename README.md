This is a module designed to work with the ITK v4 modular system; it implements a collection of classes for performing variational image registration.

The module should be placed in [ITK_root]/Modules/External/. You should then configure and compile ITK as normal.

Select the option Module_VariationalRegistration to compile this project. To do this you may have to toggle advanced mode on CMake.
